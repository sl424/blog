## New language
Learning a new language is more than just rules and vocabulary. It gives
you the connection to the people and the culture. It permits and
it requires new ways of thinking. If you want to try a new language from zero 
I recommend checking out the work at [LanguageTransfer].

For asian languages, I liked the Tae Kim Guide to [Japanese] with [Japanese Audio Flashcard].
[How To Study Korean] is also very similar, it will walk you through all the basics and more. 
For Chinese, I recommend an audio course like Pimsleur, Michel Thomas, etc. from your local library or Audible.

## New prototype ##
I have been playing with a service called SiteCast cofound by my friend Rubie and 
tried to replicate this website using her front-end IDE at [Sitecast].
And this is the result of another [website].


## New addition
There is now an API (work in progress) for this site [api] for basic information.
