				<p>I have always been fascinated by math and science and later decided to
				pursue mechanical engineering at Drexel University.
				After I received my bachelor and master degrees, I was fortunate to work at
				Hewlett-Packard and learn about the world of manufacturing and design. 
				Now, I'm working on my computer science degree and reading books 
				on Linux kernel, algorithm, and Scheme.<p>
