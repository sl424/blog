## If you know nothing about ... ##
The hardest part for me to learning Spanish was not grammtical rules or memorizing words. It was changing the way I think about the relations between subjects, verbs and posessions.
Once I got over that hurdle, it became much easier for me to comprend the grammatical rules and make connections. Speaking of making connections, while I was learning,
I tried to immerse myself in all kinds of spanish materials. They are everywhere in music, flyers, streets signs, etc.

One of the best material I found was the spanish course at Language Transfer. It really helped me with thinking in Spanish and pushed me to keep learning, speaking, writing.
`https://www.languagetransfer.org/complete-spanish`.  For me, I learned to pronounce the RR sound with the word `arroz` rice in Spanish like the audio course. The best thing is
to have fun and not stress out about it. Thats how I came away after all the audio materials.
If you are curious, I also recommend their related course Introducción a Inglés and learn English from the perspective of a Spanish learner.

## Short term goal ##
The next roadblock I ran into was improving my listening experience. I do not know what the secret to it is. Over a period of time, it change from a string of gibberish to comprehensible
and discrete nouns and verbs. My best guess is that after grammatical rules finally sink in and after I understood the sentence structures, it became much easier to disect strings
into clear chucks. Also, listening to music and guessing the lyrics was also a big help. You can check it out at `https://es.lyricstraining.com/es/`.

Other tools I used to improve my listening were spanish podcast and YouTube videos. There are so many great resources online, find a topic that you are interested in, it really
does not matter what it is. For me, it was science and history.

## Medium term goal ##
This is where I am now, I am still working on learning new vocabulary. I have been mostly ignoring memorizing vocabulary because from my personal experience with
learning English, it was not the best way for me. I learn new words best in context like spanish translated manga and books.
